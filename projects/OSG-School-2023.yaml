Description: 'I am a PhD candidate at Makerere University, Uganda, in Bioinformatics
  and Computational Biology. My project involves designing a pipeline for the computational
  design of Immunotherapy against breast cancer. My problem is an HTC problem with
  special requests of GPU resources. HTCondor and OSGPool will help me in running
  my analysis much faster and enable the exploration of more parameters within the
  tools incorporated in the pipeline. '
